    <h1>Animals</h1>
    <h2>Fets</h2>
    <p>Pets are great companions and often better friends than humans.</p>
    <h2>Farm animals</h2>
    <p> Farm animals are more useful, but they can be great friends.</p>
    <h2>Exotic animals</h2>
    <p>Exotic animals are beautiful and interesting, we just see them more often at zoos or exhibitions, but that doesn't mean they're not kept as pets.</p>
